###### Procedures for providing liquidity and obtaining rewards:

Using USDT as an example:

1. Use [`Deposit Token to FlamIncome`](#deposit) command to deposit a portion of USDT into vault and receive fUSDT (You must keep a part of your USDT tokens for providing liquidity in the following step)
2. Use [`Deposit fToken to Mint nToken`](#fton) command to convert the fUSDT that you get from the previous step to nUSDT
3. Provide liquidity in Uniswap using the newly minted nUSDT and the remaining USDT you hold. The corresponding Uniswap liquidity pool address is listed in [`Provide Liquidity in Uniswap`](#uni) section 
4. After successfully providing liquidity in Uniswap, you can use [`Stake LP Tokens`](#stake) to stake the LP tokens received from Uniswap into the staking pools
5. After staking the LP tokens for a period of time, users can find out the amount of FLAG token rewards they can get via using the [`Get Staking Earning`](#earning) operation
6. Users can also check the number of LP Tokens they staked by using [`Get Staking Amount`](#stakingamount) command
7. Lastly, users can use [`Claim Staking Rewards`](#claim) for withdrawing FLAG rewards they obtained through staking LP tokens

###### Procedures for withdrawing LP tokens and removing liquidity:

Again, taking USDT as example:

1. First, users need to withdraw LP tokens by following the [`Withdraw LP Tokens`](#withdraw) step. After withdrawing all the LP tokens users will no longer be able to receive FLAG rewards
2. After getting back LP tokens, users can remove liquidity from Uniswap. The liquidity pools address are provided in [`Remove Liquidity in Uniswap`](#removel)
3. Users will receive nUSDT after removing liquidity in Uniswap and can follow the [`Convert nToken to fToken`](#ntof) procedure to convert nUSDT to fUSDT, which can be used to withdraw tokens from FlamIncome
4. Final step, if users want to withdraw certain amount of USDT, they can use [`Withdraw Token from FlamIncome`](#withdrawToken) to perform this operation
